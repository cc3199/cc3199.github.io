          <h2>CollectionBuilder SA Software - ImageMagick and Ghostscript</h2>
          <p>Most (but not all!) CollectionBuilder projects will involve working with a collection of digital objects, i.e. JPEGs, PDFs, MP3s, etc. We use the software listed below to batch process digital files for use in CollectionBuilder-SA and -CSV projects.</p>
          <p>SA and CSV templates include a Rake task that automates creating derivative images for PDF and image items. Rake is a standard part of all Ruby installs, so if you are using Jekyll, you have it installed already!<br><br>
          However, to use CollectionBuilder’s <code>generate_derivatives</code> task you will need the command line tools ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed on your computer. These very popular open source utilities are used in numerous applications and web platforms to provide digital object processing pipelines–and can also be useful for batch processing on your personal computer.</p>
