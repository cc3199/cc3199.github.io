            <p>The MBMG Archives evolved from donations of mining- and geology-related information from agencies, individuals, or organizations.  MBMG recognizes that its collections are unique and irreplaceable and devotes resources to sustain a welcoming repository for donations of this information and promote its preservation, promotion, and use.<br><br>
            The MBMG will make every reasonable effort to identify endangered collections that are appropriate additions to its existing collections.  Such efforts will include collaboration with mining companies, regulatory agencies, museums, historical societies, professional associations, and the public through print and electronic media and promotional events.<br><br>
            The types of information collected by the MBMG Archives include, but are not limited to, mining and geologic-related maps, books, reports, photographs, geophysical logs, aerial photos, core samples, survey and mining claim documents, field notes, correspondence, and mineral samples.  The Bureau may acquire materials and/or specimens through donations from the public or private sectors, purchase or development by the MBMG itself.  All acquisitions will comply with the policies and procedures of the Montana Tech Foundation.<br><br></p>

            <h3>Collection Assessment Guidlines</h3>
            <h4><i>Physical Data</i></h4>
                <p>The MBMG will consider the following guidelines when acquiring, retaining, or disposing new physical data for its collections.  The materials must:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>pertain to the state of Montana;</li>
                        <li>not be already available in the collections;</li>
                        <li>not be available from the other libraries or archives;</li>
                        <li>add to the body of knowledge encompassed by the collections;</li>
                        <li>revise or correct early versions of the materials in the collections;</li>
                        <li>be in better physical condition than existing identical materials;</li>
                        <li>represent rare, historically significant, unique, or Montana-specific specimens or material pertaining to those areas of Montana geology.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h4><i>Digital Data</i></h4>
                <p>Digital materials are subject to the same acquisition guidelines as physical collections received by the MBMG. Additionally, acceptance of digital collections will be subject to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Media condition—media that has been damaged and is illegible will not be accepted;</li>
                        <li>Availability of technology to access the digital data—the MBMG will make a good faith effort to locate the technological means to access data on media considered out of date or obsolete. If the technology cannot be located or no longer exists, the MBMG reserves the right to refuse the acceptance of outdated media.</li>
                        <li>Availability of technology to transfer the data to current digital storage media;</li>
                        <li>Cost feasibility of accessing and transferring data to current storage media—the nature and content of the data must be irreplaceable, unique, and contribute significantly to the collection to justify the cost for access and transference to current storage media.</li>
                        <li>Before the MBMG assesses and/or accepts private or public donations of materials for the collections, the <b>prospective</b> donor will supply a detailed and complete inventory of the prospective donation. The MBMG reserves the right to review the inventory and select those items it deems appropriate for acceptance (see guidelines above). If the prospective donor plans to use the donation as a tax deduction, the donor will be responsible for securing an <b>appraisal</b> of the donated items. The MBMG will not conduct appraisals of prospective collection materials.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h3>Collection Assessment Procedures</h3>
            <h4><i>Preliminary Appraisal/Donation Suitability</i></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Archives Manager, through prospective donor discussions and existing repository review, assesses each prospective donation for its suitability as part of the MBMG Archives repository using the <b>Preliminary Collection Assessment Worksheet</b>.</li>
                        <li>The Archives Manager will complete the assessment, summarizing key benefits and concerns with the prospective collection’s acceptance, and review the preliminary appraisal with the MBMG Director. The Director may authorize the collection’s acceptance, direct the Archives manager to conduct an onsite evaluation of the collection, or decline the collection donation.</li>
                    </ol>
            <h4><i>Onsite Collection Assessment</i></h4>
                <p>If directed by the MBMG Director, the Archives Program Manager will conduct an onsite collection assessment to determine if the collection is an acceptable and appropriate addition to the Archives.</p>
                <b>Preliminary Onsite Assessment</b><br><br>
