        These tools reference photograph development techniques.  Dodging moves the image quickly past the light (dodging the light) so the resulting image is lightly developed.  Burning the image exposes it to the light longer, and the resulting image is darker.<br> The dodge tool lightens the image where brushed; the burn tool darkens where brushed. The burn tool can darken text to make it more legible.<br>

          <h3>Color Range Selection</h3>
          Color Range selection uses the "eyedropper" to select same colored pixels throughout the document.
          <ol>
            <li>First, you will need to select the color of the document and save it as the foreground color. To do this, select the foreground color in the squares in the left-side toolbar. When the window pops up, use your cursor (which will now take the shape of an eyedropper) to select anywhere on the background of the document. This will be the color used to fill in parts of the document that are not wanted to be replaced with the document color to blend in.<br><br>
              <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ '/objects/colorrange.jpg' | absolute_url }}"></li><br>

            <li>When the window pops up, use your cursor (which will now take the shape of an eyedropper) to select the section you want to select. <b>Do not press 'OK' yet.</b><br><br>
              <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ '/objects/colorrange2.jpg' | absolute_url }}"></li><br>
            <li>In the window, select the eyedropper with the little plus symbol next to it. Then click and drag over a majority of the area you want to select. This is just to ensure that all of the colored pixels in this range are selected. You may unclick and click and hold again in a different area, or even click multiple times to ensure every color you want replaced is selected.Then select 'OK'.<br><br>
              <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ '/objects/colorrange3.jpg' | absolute_url }}"></li><br>
            <li>You should see lines around the area of the colors you selected. Now navigate to 'Edit' on the main toolbar, and then down to 'Fill'.<br><br>
              <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ '/objects/colorrange4.jpg' | absolute_url }}"></li><br>
