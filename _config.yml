description: "In 1919, the Montana Legislature created the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology (MBMG or Bureau). The Bureauâ€™s mission is to collect, maintain, manage, and preserve information having enduring historic, research, and informational value, make the information available to the public, and dispose information whose enduring value has expired.

The Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology collects geologic and mineral, specimens, geologic, hydrologic, seismic, and mining-related historical photographs, reports, and analysis pertaining to the State of Montana.

MBMG created a data preservation program and Archives department that assesses, acquires, organizes, restores, and preserves historic mining, geologic, hydrogeologic, mineral, and seismic information pertaining to the state of Montana. The MBMG Data Preservation Program makes this information available to the public, in both physical and electronic formats for education and research purposes."
