## CollectionBuilder Documentation

CollectionBuilder is a digital tool developed to produce digital archives that both preserves and houses digital archival material, and is a helpful way for users to learn about the collection and access the files. This tool is essentially a web code template that is easy for users to make a digital archive without needing to know much about web coding and design. For full initial documentation please visit the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) documentation website to get started. 

The documentation below are more details specific to the MBMG Data Preservation use of CollectionBuilder. Since CollectionBuilder is an open source code template, it is very maneuverable to fit every collections' needs. Included are also some more advanced ways to manipulate the CollectionBuilder code and how to navigate it. There is a little bit of a learning curve, but once learned, it takes hardly any time to create a whole website featuring archival material.
